  "content": "Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.   Example 1: Input: haystack = \"sadbutsad\", needle = \"sad\" Output: 0 Explanation: \"sad\" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0. Example 2: Input: haystack = \"leetcode\", needle = \"leeto\" Output: -1 Explanation: \"leeto\" did not occur in \"leetcode\", so we return -1.   Constraints: 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104 haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.",
